# odin-recipes
The goal of this project is to create a main index page containing links to multiple recipes.
The completion of this project demonstrates basic HTML usage, as well as basic Git workflow

P.S: Before finishing this project, I wasn't sure wether I should include the name of the file that I changes in the Git commit message. I now realize that that is something that I probably should do make the commit more understandable
