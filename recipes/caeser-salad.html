    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Here's the best Caesar salad recipe I have ever tasted! A wonderful, rich, anchovy dressing makes this salad a meal. Serve with crusty Italian bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>5 anchovy fillets, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cups day-old bread, cubed</li>
        <li>1 head romaine lettuce, torn into bite-sized pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mince 3 cloves of garlic and place in a small bowl. Add mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, anchovies, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard; mix well to combine. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>

Cook bread cubes in hot flavored oil, turning frequently, until lightly browned; transfer onto a plate and season with salt and pepper.</li>
